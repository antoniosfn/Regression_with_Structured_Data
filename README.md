# Regression_with_Structured_Data

Task
Steps: a) Load the Air Quality Index Dataset from the link available in Canvas; b) Plot the target data NO2(G7); c) Adjust target data to prepare for modeling; d) Use time series split (5 splits) for validation; e) Compare 3 regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Naive); f) Check MSE and MAE.

================================================================================================

The comparative analysis of California housing price prediction models, implemented with Python, scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy, showed that the Decision Tree delivered more consistent performance (MSE: -0.67, MAE: ~0.60) across all preprocessing scenarios (Original, Power Transform, Z-score, and Min-Max), highlighting its robustness to data transformations. Linear Regression performed best with original or standardized data (Z-score), maintaining an MSE of -0.56 and MAE of 0.55, but was sensitive to Power Transform, which increased its MAE to 0.60. These findings indicate that for this dataset, the Decision Tree is the most suitable choice, while standardization techniques remain more beneficial for linear models.
